# CORE INTERMEDIATE HTML/CSS

This is the official Girl Develop It Core Intermediate HTML/CSS curriculum. It was developed through the contributions of Garann Means, Alexis Goldstein, Julie Pagano, Lindsey Bieda, and Izzy Johnston.

The course is meant to be taught in 4 two-hour sections or 2 4-hour sections. The total course material, including time for in-class practice, should be approximately 8 hours. It is highly recommended that students be required to take the Core HTML/CSS curriculum, or demonstrate knowledge of HTML/CSS prior to attending class, as knowledge of HTML and CSS are assumed.

### Class 3

Advances in HTML5

This class will cover additions to HTML5 beyond semantics. A significant portion of the class will focus on microdata, its formatting, and its potential effects on search and accessibility. The class will also cover new treatment of multimedia, geolocation, and, time permitting, storage.

### Class 4

Introduction to Responsive Design and Compatibility

This class will be split into two topics. The first will cover the concepts of responsive design and focus on the use of media queries. As responsive design can be its own course, the concepts will be covered broadly, rather than deeply. 

The second topic will be about compatibility with older browsers. This will include use of libraries such as Modernizr or HTML5Shiv and will also discuss the struggles of designing a website for compatibility.
